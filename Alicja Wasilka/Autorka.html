  PAINTER<br />
  PRESENTS HER IMAGES AT FAIRS AND EXHIBITIONS RELATED TO ART AND PAINTINGS<br />
  IN HER ART SHE IS LOOKING FOR A SURFACE â€“ A STRUCTURAL SPACE INTRODUCES
  ORGANIC FORMS, THAT CONTRAST WITH EXPRESIVE ACTION PAINTING AND CREATE A
  PLANNED CHAOS, VISUAL EXPRESSION OF EMOTIONS<br />
  AND SENSATIONS IS CREATED<br />
  ALICE CREATES PAINTING AND DRAWING BASED ON MIXED TECHNIQUES<br />
  SHE USED A MONOCHROMATIC PALETTE OF WHITE AND GREY, WHICH IS WHY HER ARTWORKS
  ARE DOMINATED BY AIR AND LIGHT<br />
  IN HER PAINTING, ALICE REFERS TO THE HUMAN RELATIONSHIP TO THE SURROUNDING
  REALITY, THE WORLD OF SHAPES AND OBJECTS IN ITS ORGANIC, SENSITIVE
  STRUCTURE<br />
  IN IMAGES ALICE PRESENTS THE SUBJECT OF EVANESCENCE AND PASSING, FOLLOWS THE
  LIGHT, INSPIRES THE <br />
  RECIPIENT TO OBSERVE THE LUMINOUS NATURE OF THE AIR THAT SURROUNDS ARE
  EVERYDAY LIFE
